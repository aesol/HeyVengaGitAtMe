## To Y'all over at Venga,

####Thanks so much for the opportunity to create this cover letter using Git. 

This past weekend, I participated in a Hackathon sponsored by CapitalOne. We designed and developed a new website for a local nonprofit. ***I won MVP!*** Check out the site I build in wordpress here: http://70.40.216.131/ . I built out most of the architecture for the front page.

```I can demonstrate my experience picking things up on the fly a little more, too. 	As Co-Founder and Vice President of Operations of a small business & startup, I handled all aspects of the business from customer service to code edits for our websites. I taught myself SQL, Excel Macro language, HTML and CSS as needed. My ability to learn quickly and apply the knowledge effectively is pervasive across the business. I believe managing a staff of 15, learning to coding alone and handling customer and vendor e-mail and phone calls makes me a great candidate at Venga. I work hard and see results, such as cutting operational costs by 40%, expanding our distribution from a handful of cities to 5 states, and launching a national distribution company. I'm ready to take the next step in my personal and professional life.```

####*My love for food matches my love for learning things quickly, too.*

I'm inspired by great chefs and restaurants. I just had 2Amy's pizza for the first time yesterday -- yum! I try new places as often as possible. I'm in contact with a local entrepreneur that does marketing for 11th street restaurants (RedRocks, Coupe, etc.) When I mentioned what Venga does, he thought his clients would really love that kind of guest management knowledge.

######There's even a tiny bit of JavaScript in there!

####This is all to say, I'm a fast learner that is not afraid to take on new technical challenges. I'm good with people, too.

`For me, leadership is addressing and engaging the world around me by moving beyond a linear and compartmentalized pathway; it is realizing the immense potential in collaboration. A theme of my experiences is grasping to understand how to bring many different perspectives and people together around an innovative idea or set of common goals.  By engaging with these opportunities deeply, I feel that I have, constructively and responsibly, begun to understand the power of people, place and knowledge. In this spirit, I am gratefully and humbly hoping to continue to explore this pathway at Venga.  This position presents an amazing opportunity to expand upon my experience and emphasize a results-based approach to solutions and partnership-building. I believe that the all-star team at Venga will foster and stimulate my ability to think like a leader and understand the complexity of issues and solutions.`

###With Gusto!
