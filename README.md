## To Y'all over at Venga,

###Thanks so much for the opportunity to create this cover letter using Git. 

This past weekend, I participated in a Hackathon sponsored by CapitalOne. We designed and developed a new website for a local nonprofit. I won MVP! Check out the site I build in wordpress here: http://70.40.216.131/ . I built out most of the architecture for the front page.
